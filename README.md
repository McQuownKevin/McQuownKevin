- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @McQuownKevin
- This is a collaborative "locker" for SQL scripts, for lack of a better way to define this.
- The basic idea is that one project = one SQL script.
- Why do this at all? It's an easier way for us to document and track the scripts that we use. Storing them in excel workbooks or in notepad files all over the network can be
- troublesome to track down sometimes, and it's difficult to tell if the script we're running is the latest or a prior rendition that wasn't quite finalized after the report
- was created.
